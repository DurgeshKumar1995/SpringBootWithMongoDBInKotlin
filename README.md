# [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
Spring boot project bacic CURD operation.

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".<br>
 We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
 
 ## Features
 * Create stand-alone Spring applications
 * Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
 * Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
 * Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
 * Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
 * Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
